Young java developer👀 

Worked with several large projects in Java🌱. Partly at leisure or on a small part-time job I do 📫ML📫.

I like💞️ to read various books and technical literature in my free time, as well as study new technologies, practices of writing high-quality code and architectures, watch various courses on technology, architecture and languages on YouTube, as well as Java developer conferences - Joker, JPoint, JUG.ru and SnowOne. I like to have productive discussions with people. I am reasonable, tactful, I try to find a compromise with everyone, I get in touch. I love events, I'm not afraid to perform if necessary. If the task interests me, I am ready to work beyond the norm. I like to walk, go to the gym.

There is a huge baggage of various PET projects in various languages: C, C++, Java, JS and Python. I'm not afraid to set up servers with my bare hands and write scripts for their settings. I like non-trivial tasks with non-trivial solutions. I am actively engaged in MLM research at the Institute.

I never sit around doing nothing :)
